// Arithmetic operator 

let a = 10;
let b = 4;
console.log("a + b = ", a + b)
console.log("a - b = ", a - b)
console.log("a * b = ", a * b)
console.log("a / b = ", a / b) // we did not require any float or anything likewise in c++ or java
console.log("a % b = ", a % b) // this means it will show the remainder 
console.log("a ** b = ", a ** b) // this means it will show the a ki power b for eg 10^4= 

console.log("++a = ", ++a)
console.log("a++ = ", a++)
console.log("--a = ", --a)
console.log("a-- = ", a--)
console.log("a = ", a)

// Assignment operator

let assignment = 1;
assignment += 5   // same as assignment = assignment + 5
console.log("assignment is now = ", assignment)
assignment -= 5   // same as assignment = assignment - 5
console.log("assignment is now = ", assignment)
assignment *= 5   // same as assignment = assignment * 5
console.log("assignment is now = ", assignment)
assignment /= 5   // same as assignment = assignment / 5
console.log("assignment is now = ", assignment)

// Comparison operator

let comp1 = 6;
let comp2 = "6"; // if this is the string like "6" the === says that it is false 
console.log("comp1 == comp2 is ", comp1 == comp2)
console.log("comp1 != comp2 is ", comp1 != comp2)
console.log("comp1 === comp2 is ", comp1 === comp2) // this will show the typw of the no.'s and the values
console.log("comp1 !== comp2 is ", comp1 !== comp2)

// Logical operator

let x = 5;
let y = 6;
console.log(x<y && x==5)
console.log(x>y || x==5)
console.log(!true)
console.log(!false)
